\title{SCONE Evaluation: Evaluate an Expression Matrix}
\usage{
score_matrix(expr, eval_pcs = 3, eval_proj = NULL,
  eval_proj_args = NULL, eval_kclust = NULL, bio = NULL,
  batch = NULL, qc_factors = NULL, uv_factors = NULL,
  wv_factors = NULL, is_log = FALSE, stratified_pam = FALSE,
  stratified_cor = FALSE, stratified_rle = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{matrix. The expression data matrix (genes in rows, cells in
columns).}

\item{eval_pcs}{numeric. The number of principal components to use for
evaluation (Default 3). Ignored if !is.null(eval_proj).}

\item{eval_proj}{function. Projection function for evaluation (see Details).
If NULL, PCA is used for projection}

\item{eval_proj_args}{list. List of arguments passed to projection function
as eval_proj_args (see Details).}

\item{eval_kclust}{numeric. The number of clusters (> 1) to be used for pam
tightness (PAM_SIL) evaluation. If an array of integers, largest average
silhouette width (tightness) will be reported in PAM_SIL. If NULL, PAM_SIL
will be returned NA.}

\item{bio}{factor. A known biological condition (variation to be preserved),
NA is allowed. If NULL, condition ASW, BIO_SIL, will be returned NA.}

\item{batch}{factor. A known batch variable (variation to be removed), NA is
allowed. If NULL, batch ASW, BATCH_SIL, will be returned NA.}

\item{qc_factors}{Factors of unwanted variation derived from quality
metrics. If NULL, qc correlations, EXP_QC_COR, will be returned NA.}

\item{uv_factors}{Factors of unwanted variation derived from negative
control genes (evaluation set). If NULL, uv correlations, EXP_UV_COR,
will be returned NA.}

\item{wv_factors}{Factors of wanted variation derived from positive
control genes (evaluation set). If NULL, wv correlations, EXP_WV_COR,
will be returned NA.}

\item{is_log}{logical. If TRUE the expr matrix is already logged and log
transformation will not be carried out prior to projection. Default FALSE.}

\item{stratified_pam}{logical. If TRUE then maximum ASW is separately
computed for each biological-cross-batch stratum (accepts NAs), and a
weighted average silhouette width is returned as PAM_SIL. Default FALSE.}

\item{stratified_cor}{logical. If TRUE then cor metrics are separately
computed for each biological-cross-batch stratum (accepts NAs), and
weighted averages are returned for EXP_QC_COR, EXP_UV_COR, & EXP_WV_COR.
Default FALSE.}

\item{stratified_rle}{logical. If TRUE then rle metrics are separately
computed for each biological-cross-batch stratum (accepts NAs), and
weighted averages are returned for RLE_MED & RLE_IQR. Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list with the following metrics: \itemize{ \item{BIO_SIL}{ Average
  silhouette width by biological condition.} \item{BATCH_SIL}{ Average
  silhouette width by batch condition.} \item{PAM_SIL}{ Maximum average
  silhouette width from PAM clustering (see stratified_pam argument).}
  \item{EXP_QC_COR}{ Coefficient of determination between expression
  pcs and quality factors (see stratified_cor argument).} \item{EXP_UV_COR}{
  Coefficient of determination between expression pcs and negative
  control gene factors (see stratified_cor argument).} \item{EXP_WV_COR}{
  Coefficient of determination between expression pcs and positive
  control gene factors (see stratified_cor argument).} \item{RLE_MED}{ The
  mean squared median Relative Log Expression (RLE) (see stratified_rle
  argument).} \item{RLE_IQR}{ The variance of the inter-quartile range (IQR)
  of the RLE (see stratified_rle argument).} }
}
\description{
This function evaluates a (normalized) expression matrix using SCONE
criteria, producing 8 metrics based on i) Clustering, ii) Correlations and
iii) Relative Expression.
}
\details{
Users may specify their own eval_proj function that will be used to
  compute Clustering and Correlation metrics. This eval_proj() function must
  have 2 input arguments: \itemize{ \item{e}{ matrix. log-transformed (+
  pseudocount) expression data (genes in rows, cells in columns).}
  \item{eval_proj_args}{ list. additional function arguments, e.g. prior
  data weights.}} and it must output a matrix representation of the original
  data (cells in rows, factors in columns). The value of eval_proj_args is
  passed to the user-defined function from the eval_proj_args argument of
  the main score_matrix() function call.
