### Single-Cell Overview of Normalized Expression data ###

SCONE (Single-Cell Overview of Normalized Expression), a package for single-cell RNA-seq data quality control (QC) and normalization. This data-driven framework uses summaries of expression data to assess the efficacy of normalization workflows.

### Install from Bioconductor ###

We recommend installation of the package via bioconductor.

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("scone")
```

Note that SCONE is currently in Bioconductor devel and hence requires R-devel (>= 3.4).

### Install from Github ###

Usually not recommended. SCONE is under active development. To download the development version of the package, use the `devtools` package.

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("YosefLab/scone")
```

### Install for R 3.3 ###

You can download the latest release of SCONE for R 3.3 [here](https://github.com/YosefLab/scone/releases/tag/v0.99.0).
